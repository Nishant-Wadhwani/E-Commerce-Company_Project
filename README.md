# E-Commerce-Company_Project
Let's suppose we just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.  The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired us, on contract to help them figure it out! We will use all types of regression techniques which include Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression and a Deep Learning Neural Network with two hidden layers. To improve the model performance, we will also apply model selection techniques like K-Fold Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search. In the end, we will also compare these models by checking the error functions and R2_Score to get the best model. This dataset contains 500 customers who use these online platforms in regular intervals. 


Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
Daily Time Spent on Site: consumer time on site in minutes 
Yearly Amount Spent:- Dependent Variable


Also, we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.  This data set contains the following features:  

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

Age: cutomer age in years
